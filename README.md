# Portfolio Website

## Work in Progress

Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website.
This was created using HTML and CSS. The base file was created by following Christina Truong's linkedin learning course ["CSS Essential Training"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-essential-training-3/).
I am working on updating it to include some of my certificates from linkedin learning which will be displayed using javascript and I'm also planning to add some animations to make the website look ***cool***.

          <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a third year computer engineering student at York University graduating by May 2023. I love building and trying new things out. 
            I am a quick learner and I like playing with new technologies. I am well versed in java and python and I'm interested in full-stack software development 
            as well as data engineering. I've studied the technologies and have learned the skills required for these roles. I think I am more than ready to start a career 
            in either of these roles and I would like a chance to prove how my skills, passion, and hardwork could be of value to your company.  
          </p>

            <p>
              This project was created using Java Swing, JDBC and SQL.
              It is a full stack database application that allows users to insert CFP records
              through a gui which was created using java swing, 
              and view the results of some SQL queries carried out with the help of JDBC that display the upcoming events for each
              event type and the count of the number of events grouped by the months and the type of the event.
